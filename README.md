<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

### Built With

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/Selenium)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
* [Chromium/ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
* [Tabulate](https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate)
