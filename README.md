<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

If you've tried to grab insights from RewardStyles' commission interface, you know that it's dated and unwieldy. rsCALC is designed to automate the process and enable you to make business decisions faster.

Features:
* Automatically logs in to your RewardStyle account and downloads your data from a specified date range
* Provides some at-a-glance stats for the given period:
  * Estimated Advertiser Earnings (using automatically updated brand rates)
  * Top Brands
  * Top Products
  * Top Refunds
* Combines and formats all of the data into a .csv file for easy in-house uses
